## Introduction

Machine learning is an exciting field that involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or take actions. This repository serves as a collection of my projects and code examples created while learning machine learning concepts from a textbook. The projects would be uploaded as i continue my journey
## Projects

In this repository, you will find projects covering various machine learning topics, including:

- Regression models
- Classification models
- Clustering algorithms
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Neural Networks
- Deep Learning

Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a README with detailed information about the project, its goals, and the techniques used.

## Usage

To explore the projects and code examples in this repository, simply navigate to the respective directories. Each project directory includes its own set of instructions, requirements, and usage guidelines. Follow the instructions provided in the project's README to run or experiment with the code.

Please note that some projects may have specific dependencies or data requirements. Make sure to read the project's README thoroughly to ensure a smooth setup and execution.
